# Module 5: Sentiment Analysis Hands on Tutorial

Social media data is vast and complex. Understanding how to sift through it to uncover useful content is therefore crucial. Mis- and disinformation, and harmful narratives more broadly, are especially challenging to uncover given their many nuances.

Assessing behavioural patterns of online actors can help uncover patterns of inauthenic behavioral which can serve as a signature of those spreading harmful content. There are many ways to analyse behavioural patterns, of which we will focus here on assessing coordinated behaviour - i.e. account and actors that might be working together to spread harmful narratives. Specifically we will look at:

Uncovering bot-like behaviour - i.e. the rapid sharing of the same content
The sharing of copy/pasta - i.e. the sharing of similar content
